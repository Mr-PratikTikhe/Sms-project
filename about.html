        <h1>What is a College Management System (CMS)?</h1>
        <p>"A College Management System (CMS) is a comprehensive web application designed to 
            streamline the administrative and academic processes within an educational institution. It 
            primarily serves as a centralized platform for managing students, faculty, courses, and 
            administrative tasks. In this project, we will be developing a CMS using Java for the back-end and a 
            web application for the front-end. The CMS will include features like user authentication, course 
            management, attendance tracking, grade management, and communication tools, making it easier 
            for students, faculty, and administrators to access and manage critical information efficiently. It 
            will enhance the overall educational experience by providing a user-friendly and organized 
            interface for all stakeholders, leading to better communication, easier access to resources, and 
            improved administrative efficiency.</p>
